# Privacy_enhanced_Recommendation_system
This was my course project of IE 506 (machine learning principles and technique)
in this project i implemented the [Applying Differential Privacy to Matrix Factorization](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2792838.2800173)
This paper discuss the application of Differential Privacy in Reccomendation Systems Based on Collaborative filtering approach like Matrix Factorization [you can watch this video to understannd the concept of matrix factorization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZspR5PZemcs)
* There are two different optimization approch that can be used in Matrix Factorization :
   * Alternating Least Squared (ALS)
   * Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

## ALS (Alternating Least Squares)
ALS is a matrix factorization technique used for collaborative filtering. It iteratively updates user and item latent factors to minimize the error between predicted and actual ratings.

## SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
SGD is an optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning. It updates model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function, using a subset of the data (mini-batch) at each iteration.
I have implemented both Approaches that too from scratch.

I used Movielens 100k Dataset for this purpose
I have attached detailed report of this project as well.
